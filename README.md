# Final Project

Every loan between a lender and borrower, begins with a question: Will this borrower pay me back?
But how can a lender know with confidence which factors to consider when evaluating a given borrower?
To help shed light on this question, I analyzed loan information from Lending Club as my primary dataset.

To introduce some variety i also used weather data, breast cancer data, salary data and wine data with their own distinct narratives within the respective models.
