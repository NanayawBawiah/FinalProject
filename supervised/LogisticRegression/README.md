In this model i am going to attempt to predict rainfall using historical waether data.

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the "Rain in Australia" dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., along with the target variable indicating whether it rained the following day. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation
