For Ensemble Methods i used Wine Data from Kaggle. 

Link to Data:[Wine Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)

I attempt to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, residual sugar, alcohol content) to optimize production processes and ensure consistent quality.
